# pageRankMC
Implementation of Google's *pageRank* algorithm with Markov Chains (*MC*s).

## Description
Page Rank is an algorithm used by google.com to rank web pages based on the number of links that point to that page.
By modeling this problem as a Markov chain we can predict the stable state of the model.
Simulations and theory are compared.

## Getting Started
This is a simple python notebook. Run the cells sequentially and see the results.
### Dependencies

* Requires Python3.
* Requires numpy, scipy, and matplotlib libraries which can be installed with pip.
